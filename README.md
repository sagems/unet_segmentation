### Project Background
This is a project that I began working on last spring quarter, advised by Aly Singleton and Caroline Glidden in the Mordecai Lab. The project goal is to use 2019 maps of pineapple plantations in Costa Rica to generate maps of the plantation distribution for 2020-present based on Sentinel-2 satellite data for those years. In the spring, I built a random forest model that was able to classify the satellite images with reasonable accuracy. However, further research and reviews of the literature revealed that the beast approach for such a project would be to leverage deep learning models to
