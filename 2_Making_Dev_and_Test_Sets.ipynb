        "\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "1. **Matching Images and Masks**: Matches images with their corresponding masks using filename conventions.\n",
        "2. **Random Splitting**: Randomly divides the dataset into `train`, `dev`, and `test` splits based on user-defined proportions.\n",
        "3. **Split Preservation**: Organizes the splits into subdirectories (e.g., `sentinel-tiles/train/q1/` and `mask-tiles/train/q1/`).\n",
        "4. **Cloud Operations**: Uses GCP's Python client library to copy files to new paths and optionally deletes the originals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functionality:\n",
        "- Initializes a GCS client and accesses the specified bucket.\n",
        "- Processes data for each quarter, listing and matching image and mask files.\n",
        "- Shuffles and splits the data into train, dev, and test subsets.\n",
        "- Moves the files into appropriate split directories in the same bucket.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameters:\n",
        "- `bucket_name`: Name of the GCS bucket containing the dataset.\n",
        "- `source_image_prefix`: Prefix path to the image tiles in the bucket.\n",
        "- `source_mask_prefix`: Prefix path to the mask tiles in the bucket.\n",
        "- `splits`: Dictionary defining the proportions of the dataset to allocate to each split (e.g., `{\"train\": 0.8, \"dev\": 0.1, \"test\": 0.1}`).\n",
        "- `seed`: Random seed for reproducibility in dataset splitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "- Update the `bucket_name`, `source_image_prefix`, and `source_mask_prefix` to match the structure of your GCS bucket.\n",
        "- Define the desired split proportions in the `splits` dictionary.\n",
        "- Execute the script to organize the dataset into training, development, and testing splits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dependencies:\n",
        "- Requires `google-cloud-storage` library for interacting with GCS.\n",
        "- Assumes a valid GCP authentication JSON file is available and set via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`."
