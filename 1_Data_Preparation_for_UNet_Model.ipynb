        "This notebook provides a workflow for tiling GeoTIFF images and uploading the resulting tiles to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. It assumes that there are four quarters, and that the geotiffs and masks for each quarter are titled as:\n",
        "- image_q1_2019.tif\n",
        "- image_q2_2019.tif\n",
        "- image_q3_2019.tif\n",
        "- image_q4_2019.tif\n",
        "- mask_q1_2019.tif\n",
        "- mask_q2_2019.tif\n",
        "- mask_q3_2019.tif\n",
        "- mask_q4_2019.tif\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:\n",
        "1. **Install and Load Dependencies**:\n",
        "   - Sets up the required Python libraries, including `rasterio` for geospatial processing and `google-cloud-storage` for interacting with GCS.\n",
        "   - Mounts Google Drive to access necessary files, such as GeoTIFFs and GCP authentication credentials.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tiling Functionality**:\n",
        "   - Splits large GeoTIFF images into smaller, square tiles of a defined size (e.g., 128x128 pixels).\n",
        "   - Supports differentiation between image tiles (e.g., satellite images) and mask tiles (e.g., segmentation masks) based on the filename.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Quarter-Based Organization**:\n",
        "   - Automatically organizes tiles into folders corresponding to quarters (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `q4`) based on filenames.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Google Cloud Storage Integration**:\n",
        "   - Uploads the generated tiles to a specified GCS bucket.\n",
        "   - Organizes tiles into the appropriate directories (`sentinel-tiles` or `mask-tiles`) within the bucket.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Edge Case Handling**:\n",
        "   - Excludes tiles that do not match the expected size (e.g., tiles from the edges of the image).\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Use:\n",
        "1. **Setup**:\n",
        "   - Install the necessary Python packages by running the installation cell.\n",
        "   - Replace the placeholder in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable with the path to your GCP credentials JSON file.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Define Tiling and Upload Functions**:\n",
        "   - The notebook includes reusable functions for tiling (`tile_and_upload`) and uploading files (`upload_to_gcp`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Configure Parameters**:\n",
        "   - Specify the list of GeoTIFF file paths in `geotiff_paths`.\n",
        "   - Set the target GCS bucket name in the `bucket_name` variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Run the Tiling and Upload Workflow**:\n",
        "   - The loop iterates over all specified GeoTIFF files, tiles them, and uploads the resulting tiles to the GCS bucket.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "- GeoTIFF tiles are uploaded to the specified GCS bucket in a structured format:\n",
        "\n",
        "Bucket: 230-project-tiles\n",
        "  - sentinel-tiles\n",
        "      - q1\n",
        "      - q2\n",
        "      - q3\n",
